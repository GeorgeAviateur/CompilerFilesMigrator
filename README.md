# 🚀 Compiler Files Migrator

This script makes things easy when you need to **transfer files created after compilation** and grab a cuppa at the same time. ☕
## 👤 Who is this intended for?
Anyone who needs to <sup>frequently transfer files</sup> between the same origin/destination paths.

## 🤔 What does this script do?

Usually, after building or publishing your solution (code), there is a generated folder in bin or a custom target.
The developer wants to move some of these folders related to their project to a server ( QA server, Developer server, etc.).
Finding your folders inside big projects is a trauma no one wants to deal with. You spend 15 valuable minutes looking for your files again and again.

## It sounds awful and familiar?
What if I tell you that here, you just need to set your folders, run the script in a console and wait for the magic to happen. ✨

# 🧰 How to use this beauty?
